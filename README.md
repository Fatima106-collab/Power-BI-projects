I‚Äôve used Power BI to create an interactive Item Sales Summary Report, allowing users to filter by different categories such as employee, customer, city, and buying group. Key metrics tracked include:
Total Sales: $20M
Total Profit: $9.92M
Total Quantity Sold: 1M
Profitability: 49.9%
Cost: $9.96M

The report also provides insights by year and state, showcasing trends in total sales, profit, and item quantities sold. With a detailed view of sales data, this report helps analyze the performance of various stock items.
The visualizations include:
- Sales performance over time
- Total sales by stock item
- Sales and profit comparisons across different states
